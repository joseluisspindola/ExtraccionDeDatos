There is an American style bar (pub) across the road from the apartment, whereby you can get American food and local drinks.  A modern coffee shop 'The Grind' is 10 Min away too.

The neighborhood is also conveniently located near the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, which can whisk you downtown in minutes. <br /><br />Up-and-coming vibe: Claremont is a neighborhood on the rise. You'll find a mix of residential streets with historic homes and new developments offering modern apartments. There's also a growing restaurant scene on nearby West Side Avenue.<br /><br />Easy access to green spaces: Take a break from the city life at nearby Liberty State Park or venture a little further to the expansive greenery of Audubon Park.<br /><br />Here are some things to consider as well:<br /><br />Limited grocery options: While there are some smaller shops for essentials, there aren't any major supermarkets within walking distance. However,  a Light Rail ride can bring you to larger grocery stores downtown.",84535899,Fayiz,"New York, NY",within a few hours,88%,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/2aae20be-3c46-45bc-93d7-480f8f5e7a3f.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,Greenville,2,t,Neighborhood highlights,,-74.08457,Entire home/apt,1.0,2.0,"[""Cooking basics"", ""Body soap"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Kitchen"", ""TV"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Wifi"", ""Microwave"", ""Oven"", ""Toaster"", ""Self check-in"", ""Coffee"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Lockbox"", ""Hangers"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Conditioner"", ""Fire pit"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Bed linens"", ""Hot water"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""First aid kit"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Freezer"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Iron"", ""Clothing storage"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Heating"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Stove"", ""Exterior security cameras on property"", ""Shampoo""]",28,28,365,28.0,,30,90,2025-03-18,3,270,168,2024-09-02,4.0,5.0,4.67,3.67,t,2,0
