I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.
