I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to college in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. I currently live in Jersey City.

I am a real estate agent and property manager, and in my spare time I enjoy long walks in the neighborhood, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My partner Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in Jersey City & NYC.

Located just across the Hudson River from Lower Manhattan, it’s part of the New York metropolitan area. The city’s architecture ranges from Industrial Age homes to classic brownstones to modern high rises. Downtown Jersey City, a major historical district, overlooks the Manhattan skyline. The waterfront section of the city is nicknamed “Wall Street West” for being home to several employers in the financial services, securities and insurance industries. The lofty office buildings, including the highly distinctive Goldman Sachs Tower, create a stunning skyline. With its proximity to Manhattan, Jersey City is popular among young professionals working in New York City looking for an alternative to living in one of the five boroughs. It is also one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world, with large populations of Hispanic, Asian and Indian Americans.
